TFAR is a mod for Arma 3 that adds realistic positional VOIP as well as a highly configurable radio system.

## Install Guide
Since we are running TFAR you will need to install it, this is a more involved process than simply downloading a mod in the workshop.

1. Download and install TS3 client on your computer https://www.teamspeak.de/en/download/
	1 Launch TS3 and adjust your audio settings 
         Top Bar **Tools** -> Bottom most Drop Down **Options** or alt+P 
2. Download the TFAR mod **Task Force Arrowhead Radio (BETA)** from the workshop  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894678801
3. Open your Arma 3 Launcher and search for **Task Force Arrowhead Radio (BETA)**. Click on the mod **Display more options** -> **Open folder in Windows Explorer** this will prompt a popup warning, simply click `I understand`.
